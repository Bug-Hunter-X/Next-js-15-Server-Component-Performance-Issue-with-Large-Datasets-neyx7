In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with large amounts of data.  The issue is not readily apparent; instead of a clear error message, the application might exhibit unexpected behavior, such as slow loading times or incomplete rendering of the page. This is because server components, by design, are meant for short, efficient operations.  Attempting to process large datasets within them can lead to excessive execution times, causing the request to time out or the server to become unresponsive.
