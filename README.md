This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in Next.js 15 server components when handling large datasets. The `serverComponentBug.js` file showcases the problem, while `serverComponentSolution.js` provides an optimized solution.  The issue isn't a syntax error; rather, it's a performance bottleneck.  The solution focuses on efficient data fetching and processing to avoid exceeding request timeouts.
